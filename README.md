**John Titor: The Time Traveler** is a HTML5 (mobile responsive) canvas game made with vanilla javascript/jQuery. 
Player has to choose to believe in John Titor and focus effort on researching technology tree related to time travel OR decides to debunk John's story as a hoax by researching different technologies to expose John.

### Project Challenges

- Apply HTML/CSS/Javascript/Jquery skill learned in class
- Explore and choose different technologies that can be used for making browser games. Eg. Phaser, Rpg.js, and Canvas
- Being able to pick up Canvas and make a game in a short amount of time (1 week project)
- Making canvas responsive and adjust to different screen size and scales
- Separate out game dialog scripts and rendering into separate files for better readability

### Game Design

As an experienced game player, I would like to create a game that includes elements of graphic novel/resource management/research new technology/multi-ending.

As a player, I want the game to be rich in story telling because then I would be inclined to finish the game. To start out with I would include minimal story telling and make it scallable so game can expand in depth.

### Game Background

>Time Travel Institute forums on November 2, 2000, under the name TimeTravel_0

Game starts with a slack message from John Titor who is claiming he's a time traveler from the future and letting the player know the required research into building a time machine.

Player has to choose to believe in John Titor and focus effort on researching
technology tree related to time travel OR decides to debunk John's story as a hoax by researching different technologies to expose John.

### Completed

- [ x ] **Game Title and Logo** - As a player, I would like to see game title and logo so that the game will be more recognizable to me.

- [ x ] **Research Point on the title bar** - As a player, I do NOT want to be glued to the game and would like to wait for the research point to be slowly accmulated and later come back to the game for more story event or new techs and I want it this way because I would be more inclined to keep the game running while I watch youtube and other stuff.

- [ x ] **Game Intro** - I would like to see background story of John Titor as intro and him acting as my guide to build the time machine through the game.

- [ x ] **Dialog Box** - game guide and message alerting to events to me allows me to make sense of what is going on.

- [ x ] **Characters** - I would like to see different characters pop-up talking to me as the game progress because it adds extra visual element to the game

- [ x ] **Different background** - As a player, I would like to see different background images as the game progress because I will get tired of the same visual element.

- [ x ] **Overlay in the middle** - Graphical representation of events/research in the middle that gives me more information on the research currently being conducted.

- [ x ] **Resource Management**- As a player, I gain research point when I climb different research tree because this gives me an advantage in research progression

- [ x ] **Technology Tree** - Tree of technology to research because it allows me to take different paths based on my decisions.

- [ x ] **Effect on icons when clicked** - As a player, I would like to see color change or effect when I click on icons because this allows me to tell if I actually clicked on it or not.

- [ x ] **Animating icons** - As a player, I would like to see animating effect on images this allows me to tell when something got changed instead of instantly appearing on scrren which gets hard when new item appears.

- [ x ] **Ending** - I win when the time machine is built and allows me to alter history or take a different path to debunk John Titor's story as a hoax thus erasing other alternate reality and only MY timeline exist.

- [ x ] **ICONs on the right side/darkens/brightens/hovers display info** - icon selections brighten and darkened as research points allows because this is an easy way for me to tell which research ideas to pursue and what advantage it gives me.

- [ x ] **Place favicon/Title on the tab** - as a user of browser, using favicon should be standard.

- [ x ] **More organized icons** - As a player, it is an eye sore to see un-organized list of icons

- [ x ] **Sound/Music** - As a game player, audio files should play along when the tech appear to make the game more immsersive for me.

### Icebox


- [ ] **Different branches in tech tree** - As a gamer, I like to have different branches in research area because it's based on my playing style.

- [ ] **Advanced story** - I would like to see increase in depth of the story.

- [ ] **Scrolling** - It should allow me to scroll up and down  to give me the history of events.

- [ ] **Save/Load** - As a player, if it is a long game, I would like to save/load because I do not want to lose my hard earned research points.

- [ ] **Randomized Events** - events that strengthen or hinders my research speed because this adds element of surprise which is adds fun and expectation.

- [ ] **Depth in technology tree** - As a gamer, I like to have more technologies because it's fun to "CLIMB" tech trees.
