As an experienced game player, I would like to see a game that includes elements of resource management/team building/research new technology

* Team - I would like to see a set of friends in the beginning that have different skill sets to contribute to your team because this allows the characters as guide to game story progression and alert me to random events.

* Resource Management- As a player, I gain research point when I climb different research tree because this gives me an advantage in research progression

* Technology Tree - Tree of technology to research because it allows me to take different paths based on my decisions.

* Randomized Events - events that strengthen or hinders my research speed because this adds element of surprise which is adds fun and expectation.

* Different Ending - As game player, I would like to have the freedom of choices that progress me to multiple endings.

* Winning/Losing - I win when the time machine is built and allows me to alter history, thus erasing other alternate reality and only MY timeline exist.

* Story Rich - As a player, I want the game to be rich in story telling because then I would be inclined to finish the game. To start out with I would include minimal story telling and make it scallable so game can expand in depth.

DONE:

* Game Title and Logo - As a player, I would like to see game title and logo so that the game will be more recognizable to me.

* Research Point on the title bar - As a player, I do NOT want to be glued to the game and would like to wait for the research point to be slowly accmulated and later come back to the game for more story event or new techs and I want it this way because I would be more inclined to keep the game running while I watch youtube and other stuff.

* Game Intro - I would like to see background story of John Titor as intro and him acting as my guide to build the time machine through the game.

* Dialog Box - game guide and message alerting to events to me allows me to make sense of what is going on.

* Characters - I would like to see different characters pop-up talking to me as the game progress because it adds extra visual element to the game

* Different background - As a player, I would like to see different background images as the game progress because I will get tired of the same visual element.

* Overlay in the middle - Graphical representation of events/research in the middle that gives me more information on the research currently being conducted.

ICEBOX:

* Surrealism -  Visually I would like to see familiar surrounding such as mac windows/terminal/slack and some real events that happened because this allows me to be more immersive into the game and give me a sense of surrealism.

* Place Logo/Title on the upper left - it allows me to go back to main page.

* ICONs on the left side/darkens/brightens/hovers display info - icon selections brighten and darkened as research points allows because this is an easy way for me to tell which research ideas to pursue and what advantage it gives me.

* Advanced story - I would like to see increase in depth of the story.

* Scrolling - It should allow me to scroll up and down  to give me the history of events.

* Save/Load - As a player, if it is a long game, I would like to save/load because I do not want to lose my hard earned research points.
