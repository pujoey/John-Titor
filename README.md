# Project 1: The Game

As an experienced game player, I would like to see a game that includes elements of resource management/team building/research new technology

* Team building - Include a set of friends in the beginning that have different skill sets to be in your party because this allows the game to guide me and alert me to random events.

* Resource Management- Party gains research point when I prioritize different tasks to research topics that give because this gives me an advantage, aka gain research faster

* Technology tree - Large tree of technology to research.

* Randomized Events - events that strengthen or hinders my research speed because this adds element of surprise which is adds fun and expectation.

* Winning/Losing - I win when the time machine is built and allows me to alter history, thus erasing other alternate reality and only MY timeline exist.
	
* Surrealism -  Visually I would like to see familiar surrounding such as mac windows/terminal/slack and some real events that happened because this allows me to be more immersive into the game and give me a sense of surrealism.

* Place Logo/Title on the upper left - it allows me to go back to main page.
	
* ICONs on the left side/darkens/brightens/hovers display info - icon selections brighten and darkened as research points allows because this is an easy way for me to tell which research ideas to pursue and what advantage it gives me.

* Messages/Events on the right side - game guide and message alerting to events to me allows me to make sense of what is going on.  It should allow me to scroll up and down  to give me the history of events.
	
* Window in the middle - Graphical representation of events/research in the middle that gives me more information on the research currently being conducted.
